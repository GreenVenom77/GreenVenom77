I'm a CS Major in Suez University.
Started programming before going to college with some basic web stuff like JS and knew a little about Python, after going to college took an interest to Game Development and started my own journey as a hobbyist and started with Unity and took got some C# knowledge because of it and made some projects with the language like a restaurant system called Khayaal (you can find it on my github profile) and some other private projects on unity and I have 2 of them on public the first is Capsule Wars which was a project to test a wave system for Unity's NavMesh and the Second is Filters Lab which is a project to test my overall skills with Unity's camera and try to test my skills in multiplayer and got image filters asset to be the core of the game itself where you can open your phone camera and apply the filters there while still maintaining the basics of character controlling with a joystick and moving the screen around the player.

Skills: Fast Learner / Unity / C# / Fishnet Networking / PostgreSql

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a small game called (Filters Lab) it's a small mobile game that you can use image filters and have your phone camera on to apply them and have some fun and I have it's repo public for everyone to see and add on it if they want. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Android development specifically Kotlin with Jetpack Compose to have a larger knowledge base and might make it my main field.
